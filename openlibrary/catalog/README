INSTALLATION

you need python2.4, and, to import MARC catalogs, whatever
is required by catalog/marc/marc8_to_utf8.pl, including
this:

http://search.cpan.org/dist/MARC-Charset/

you can test that the script is in basic working order by
running test-marc8_to_utf8.sh while in that directory.

HOW TO IMPORT CATALOG DATA

CATALOG=(this directory)
SOURCE_DATA=(path to data)

> # edit $MYDIR/config.sh
> $CATALOG/import.sh $MYDIR/config.sh "marc" "LC" "marc_records_scriblio_net/part01.dat" <$SOURCE_DATA
